# Moving_Circles_1

## Overview
"Moving_Circles_1" is a visual experiment featuring 20 slightly offset concentric circles that continuously undulate, shrink, and grow over time. The effect is a mesmerizing, rhythmic motion that creates a hypnotic and calming visual display.

Originally developed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted for the desktop version to ensure smoother performance and visual quality.

## Features
- 20 concentric circles that shift, grow, and shrink with time.
- Slightly offset circles create a subtle, mesmerizing visual effect.

## How to Run
1. Open the `moving_circles_1.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch as the circles animate in a rhythmic, mesmerizing motion.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations may experiment with adding interactivity, such as allowing the user to control the size or speed of the undulations.

## Learnings
This project allowed for exploration of visual animation using simple shapes and movement patterns. It demonstrated how subtle offsets and rhythmic changes can create calming, hypnotic visuals.
