# Double_Pendulum

## Overview
"Double_Pendulum" is a classic simulation of a double pendulum system, where a pendulum is suspended by another pendulum, resulting in chaotic motion. This project showcases the unpredictable yet beautiful dynamics of the double pendulum. Additionally, a custom rainbow function has been implemented to color the path of the pendulum, creating a striking visual pattern as the pendulum traces its motion.

## Features
- Accurate simulation of a double pendulum system.
- Rainbow-colored path that highlights the pendulumâ€™s chaotic motion in an artistic way.
- Beautiful, dynamic visualization that changes with every run of the simulation.
  
## How to Run
1. Open the `double_pendulum.pde` file in Processing.
2. Press "Run" to start the simulation.
3. Watch the double pendulum move chaotically, leaving behind a colorful path that forms intricate, mesmerizing patterns.

## Learnings
This project deepened my understanding of chaotic systems, as well as the mathematics behind pendulum dynamics. I also gained experience in using color functions to enhance visual appeal in scientific simulations.

## Future Improvements
- Ability to adjust initial conditions, such as lengths and masses of the pendulums, for different behavior.
- Real-time user control to alter parameters and observe changes in the chaotic patterns.
