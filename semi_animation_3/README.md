# Semi_Animation_3

## Overview
"Semi_Animation_3" is the third iteration in the semi-animation series, introducing randomness to the previously structured motion. Initially, the semicircle strips start aligned together to form a perfect semicircle. Once the animation begins, the semicircles start rotating in random directions, each with a unique angular velocity. This creates a dynamic and unpredictable visual effect, adding complexity and variation to the motion.

This project takes the rhythmic motion of the earlier iterations and adds an element of chaos, creating a visually engaging experience.

## Features
- Semicircle strips begin in a unified semicircle formation.
- Each strip rotates in random directions with random angular velocities after the start.
- A more chaotic, dynamic visual effect compared to previous versions.

## How to Run
1. Open the `semi_animation_3.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch as the semicircles start together and then rotate in random directions with varying speeds, creating a constantly changing pattern.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations could introduce additional interaction, such as user control over angular velocity or direction.

## Learnings
This iteration allowed me to explore randomness in animation, introducing unpredictability to the motion of geometric shapes. It was a valuable exercise in balancing randomness with visual coherence.
