# Game_Tic_Tac_Toe

## Overview
"Game_Tic_Tac_Toe" is a simple, clean implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game. It features a two-player mode where players take turns playing as X and O on the same device. The game keeps track of the score, recording how many matches each player has won, and also detects when a tie occurs.

Originally developed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been adapted to run on the desktop version to enhance gameplay and user interaction.

## Features
- Two-player mode where X and O alternate turns on the same device.
- Keeps score of the number of wins for each player.
- Detects ties and displays the outcome.
- Clean and intuitive interface.

## How to Run
1. Open the `game_tic_tac_toe.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Two players take turns placing Xs and Os. The game will automatically track wins and ties.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Currently, there is no option to play against a computer opponent. Future iterations could implement an AI to make the game more versatile.

## Learnings
This project helped me understand the logic behind turn-based games, win detection, and scorekeeping, all while ensuring a clean user interface and smooth gameplay.
