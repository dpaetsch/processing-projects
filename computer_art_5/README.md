# Computer_Art_5

## Overview
"Computer_Art_5" builds on the concept from "Computer_Art_4," but with a significant enhancement: the afterimage effect now permanently follows the lightstick’s path rather than resetting every 10 frames. This creates a continuous and evolving visual trail as the baton-like lightstick spins, producing a more persistent and captivating afterimage effect. The result is a more immersive and fluid display of spinning light.

This project delves deeper into the effects of motion persistence, providing a richer and more engaging visual experience.

## Features
- A baton-like lightstick spins to create an afterimage effect.
- The afterimage permanently follows the lightstick’s path.
- A continuous, fluid display of light and motion without resetting.

## How to Run
1. Open the `computer_art_5.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Observe as the lightstick spins, with its afterimage permanently following its path across the screen.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future enhancements could involve experimenting with different afterimage effects and patterns to further explore visual possibilities.

## Learnings
This project offered a deeper understanding of motion persistence and its impact on visual art, demonstrating how a continuous afterimage effect can enhance the perception of spinning light.
