# Starfield

## Overview
"Starfield" is an interactive visual program that simulates moving through space, inspired by the hyperspace travel effect in *Star Wars*. The stars appear to fly past the viewer, and the speed of the effect can be controlled by moving the mouse horizontally across the screen. Move your mouse to the left to slow down and to the right to speed up the starfield.

Originally developed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted for the desktop version.

## Features
- Simulated starfield effect reminiscent of hyperspace travel.
- Mouse-controlled speed: left slows down, right speeds up.

## How to Run
1. Open the `starfield.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Control the speed of the stars by moving your mouse horizontally.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future enhancements could include adding more interaction, like altering the depth or perspective of the stars.

## Learnings
This project taught the fundamentals of 3D space manipulation, object speed control based on user input, and creating immersive visual experiences.
