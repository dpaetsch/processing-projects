# Ants

## Overview
"Ants" is a simple simulation designed to mimic ants walking across the screen. The purpose of the project was to create the illusion of having ants crawling on your phone screen, with the goal of provoking the user’s instinct to squish them. While the movement of the ants isn't entirely realistic, the visual effect is still amusing.

Originally developed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted for the desktop version.

## Features
- A playful simulation of ants walking randomly across the screen.
- Designed to trigger a reaction from the user to "squish" the ants.

## How to Run
1. Open the `ants.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch the ants walk across the screen, simulating a playful, buggy effect.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- The ants don’t move in a particularly realistic way. Future improvements could focus on better ant-like movement algorithms.

## Learnings
This project was an experiment in simulating randomness and basic movement patterns. It also provided insight into how user perception can be influenced by simple visual cues.
