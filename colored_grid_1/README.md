# Colored_Grid_1

## Overview
"Colored_Grid_1" is the first iteration of a series of projects exploring grid-based visual effects. In this version, a grid of squares is displayed, where each square changes to a random color independently from the others on each frame. The result is a visually striking and trippy effect as the colors constantly shift and vary across the grid.

Originally designed for Processing, this project offers a simple but effective way to explore color randomness and dynamic grid-based visuals.

## Features
- A grid of squares, each with a random color that changes every frame.
- Independent color changes for each square, creating a dynamic and unpredictable visual experience.
- Trippy, hypnotic effect due to the constant color variation.

## How to Run
1. Open the `colored_grid_1.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch the grid of squares as their colors shift randomly with each frame, creating a trippy visual effect.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations could explore adding user control to modify the grid size or influence the randomness of the colors.

## Learnings
This project was an introduction to working with grids and randomness in Processing. The experience deepened my understanding of how independent variables can create complex and visually engaging effects.
