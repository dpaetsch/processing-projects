# Raycasting_3

## Overview
"Raycasting_3" enhances the light simulation by making the light source controllable via the mouse. The project features a uniform grid of boxes that interact with the light rays, creating intricate and mesmerizing patterns as the light source is moved. This setup allows for dynamic exploration of how different light patterns are formed based on the light sourceâ€™s position, offering a more interactive and visually engaging experience.

The project builds on previous raycasting concepts by adding user control and exploring the effects of light on a structured grid.

## Features
- Light source controlled via mouse movement.
- Uniform grid of boxes that interact with light rays.
- Creates intricate and mesmerizing light patterns based on the light source's position.

## How to Run
1. Open the `raycasting_3.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Move the mouse to control the light source and observe the patterns of light that form on the grid of boxes.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future improvements could include adding more interactive elements or refining the grid and light interactions for even more complex patterns.

## Learnings
This project demonstrated the impact of user control on light simulation and explored how light patterns evolve in response to changes in the light source's position, providing insights into dynamic visual effects.
