# Bouncing_Balls_Lines

## Overview
"Bouncing_Balls_Lines" is the next iteration of the original "Bouncing_Balls" project. In this version, the background never resets, meaning the previous frames of the balls' movement remain visible on the screen. This creates a mesmerizing effect where the balls leave trails, forming dynamic, overlapping lines as they bounce around the screen.

Originally designed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted for the desktop version to improve performance and achieve a smoother visual experience.

## Features
- 200 balls, each with random positions, velocities, and directions.
- The background does not reset, allowing the trails of the balls to persist and form continuous lines.
- Balls bounce off the edges, creating dynamic line patterns.

## How to Run
1. Open the `bouncing_balls_lines.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch as the balls bounce around and leave continuous lines behind them, creating mesmerizing patterns.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations could introduce variations in color, thickness of the lines, or interactions between the lines formed by different balls.

## Learnings
This iteration expanded upon the basic movement logic by exploring visual persistence. The effect of not resetting the background opened up new avenues for creating visually compelling and complex patterns.
