# Button_Square_Template

## Overview
"Button_Square_Template" is a template that contains a reusable button class, this time featuring a square-shaped, opaque button. Like the circular button template, this button detects when it is clicked with the mouse and can be easily integrated into various projects. It's a foundational component for building user interfaces in Processing.

Originally developed for Processing, this square button template offers a versatile option for projects requiring simple, clickable UI elements.

## Features
- A square, opaque button class that detects mouse clicks.
- Reusable and customizable for different projects.
- Provides a basic foundation for user interface elements in Processing.

## How to Run
1. Open the `button_square_template.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Click on the square button to test the interaction.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Like the circular button template, future iterations could include additional features like hover states, button animations, or keyboard-based interactions.

## Learnings
This project further expanded my understanding of creating user interface components, providing flexibility in the design of interactive elements for future projects.
