# Game_Click_Balls

## Overview
"Game_Click_Balls" is an interactive game where you need to click on 10 moving balls as quickly as possible. Each ball moves at a different speed, and the faster you click on them, the more points you earn. At the end of the game, your score is displayed along with the time it took you to finish, and the highest score of the game is tracked. Players can choose to replay the game to improve their score and time.

## Features
- 10 randomly moving balls that increase the challenge with varying speeds.
- Score based on how quickly you click on the balls.
- Tracks and displays the player's score, time taken, and highest score at the end of each game.
- Option to replay the game.

## How to Play
1. Open the `game_click_balls.pde` file in Processing.
2. Press "Run" to start the game.
3. Click on all 10 balls as quickly as possible.
4. After the game ends, the score, time, and highest score will be displayed.
5. Click "Play Again" to try and beat your previous score and time!

## Future Improvements
- Adding difficulty settings (e.g., smaller balls or faster movement).
- Introducing a timer countdown for a more competitive element.
- Adding a global high score tracker for multiple sessions.

## Learnings
This project focused on implementing dynamic movement, user interaction with objects, and score/time tracking in a game. Additionally, it explored game loop mechanics for replayability.
