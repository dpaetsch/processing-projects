# Hallucination

## Overview
"Hallucination" is a visual experiment that displays an image resembling an optical illusion, specifically a swirling whirlpool pattern. The effect is generated using a predescribed 2D equation, and the parameters of the equation change dynamically based on the movement of the mouse. The result is a mesmerizing, interactive visual display.

Originally developed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted for the desktop version.

## Features
- Interactive optical illusion that reacts to mouse movements.
- Dynamic parameter adjustments based on user input.

## How to Run
1. Open the `hallucination.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Move the mouse to change the parameters of the visual and watch the illusion morph in real time.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future improvements could involve adding more complex interaction options or experimenting with different equations for varied effects.

## Learnings
This project provided insight into how mathematical equations can create fascinating visual effects, and how user interaction can be tied to dynamic visual transformations in real time.
