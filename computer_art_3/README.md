# Computer_Art_3

## Overview
"Computer_Art_3" utilizes parametric functions to create intriguing visuals that resemble a sphere contained within cylinders. By painting dots on the screen according to a specific pattern defined by these functions, the program generates a unique and engaging representation of geometric forms. The resulting structure combines the fluidity of a sphere with the rigidity of cylindrical boundaries, producing a visually captivating effect.

This project explores the fusion of mathematical functions and geometric shapes to create complex and aesthetically pleasing patterns.

## Features
- Parametric functions generate a visual pattern resembling a sphere inside cylinders.
- Dots are arranged in a specific pattern to create the desired geometric effect.
- A striking blend of spherical and cylindrical forms.

## How to Run
1. Open the `computer_art_3.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Observe as the program paints a pattern on the screen that evokes a sphere contained within cylinders.
