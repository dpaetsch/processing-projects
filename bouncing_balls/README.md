# Bouncing_Balls

## Overview
"Bouncing_Balls" is a simple yet dynamic program that features 200 balls, each with a random initial position, velocity, and direction. The balls move in straight lines across a square screen, bouncing off the edges as they reach the boundaries. This project was my first-ever programming endeavor, making it a significant milestone in my coding journey.

Originally designed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted for the desktop version to ensure smoother performance.

## Features
- 200 balls, each with random positions and movement directions.
- Balls move linearly and bounce off the edges of the screen.
- Simple collision detection with screen boundaries.

## How to Run
1. Open the `bouncing_balls.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch as the 200 balls bounce and move across the screen in random directions.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- This project is a simple simulation with linear movement. Future improvements could involve adding more complex physics or interactions between the balls.

## Learnings
This project was my introduction to programming, teaching me the basics of object-oriented programming, movement logic, and boundary detection. It laid the foundation for my later, more complex projects.
