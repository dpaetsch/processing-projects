# Processing Projects

This repository is a collection of small projects created with [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) by [dpaetsch](https://github.com/dpaetsch). These projects were developed during high school as part of a learning journey to understand programming concepts and to explore creative coding.

These projects were orginially made for the mobile version of the app, but most have them have been reformatted to fit the desktop version.

## Projects

Each project is contained in its own folder. Below is a brief overview of the different projects included:

#### Useful Tools:
- **two_choices**: simple project was originally created to help decide whether to skip class or not.

#### Finished Games:

#### Cool Concepts:
- **hallucination**: A dynamic optical illusion whirlpool that changes based on mouse movement, created using a 2D equation.
- **starfield**: An interactive starfield effect inspired by Star Wars hyperspace travel, with mouse-controlled speed.
- **ants**: A playful simulation of ants walking across your screen, designed to evoke the urge to squish them.
- **terrain**: A procedural terrain generator simulating high-speed flight over a landscape, originally developed for mobile but reformatted for desktop due to performance limitations.
- **raycasting_1**: A simple raycasting simulation where a movable light source casts rays that interact with walls, with future iterations planned.

#### Nice Animations:
- **moving_circles_1**: A mesmerizing animation of 20 slightly offset concentric circles that undulate, shrink, and grow with time.
- **moving_circles_2**: An interactive illusion of a 3D cone created by concentric circles, with mouse movement revealing patterns like a flower.

#### Miscellaneous:



Please note that some of the projects may be unfinished or experimental, as they were part of the learning process.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code. Each project has its own set of instructions and requirements, which are included in their respective folders.
