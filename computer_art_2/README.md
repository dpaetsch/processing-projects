# Computer_Art_2

## Overview
"Computer_Art_2" uses parametric equations to generate a visually captivating rose-like structure. Dots are painted on the screen following a specific mathematical pattern, creating a delicate and beautiful form reminiscent of a flower. The intricate shapes emerge naturally from the underlying parametric functions, showcasing the elegance of mathematical art.

This project demonstrates the power of combining math and creativity to produce beautiful visuals with simple yet effective patterns.

## Features
- Parametric functions generate a rose-like structure using dots.
- Dots are painted in a precise pattern, creating a visually stunning shape.
