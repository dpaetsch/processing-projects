# Semi_Animation_4

## Overview
"Semi_Animation_4" is the fourth iteration in the semi-animation series, where all semicircle strips start with an initial angle of 0. Gradually, the angle of each strip increases over time, with each strip eventually completing a full semicircle. This iteration introduces a smooth progression from a flat starting point to the complete circular motion, providing a more controlled and predictable visual experience compared to the randomness of previous iterations.

This project highlights a gradual build-up of motion, showcasing the transformation of shapes over time.

## Features
- Semicircle strips start with an angle of 0.
- Each strip's angle increases gradually until a full semicircle is formed.
- Smooth, controlled animation that transitions the semicircles from flat to fully rotated.

## How to Run
1. Open the `semi_animation_4.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch as the semicircle strips slowly increase their angle, eventually completing the entire circle.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Potential future enhancements include variable speed control or user interaction for adjusting the angle.

## Learnings
This iteration allowed me to explore the controlled increase of angular motion, emphasizing smooth transitions in animation. It provided valuable insights into creating predictable, progressive animations with geometric shapes.
