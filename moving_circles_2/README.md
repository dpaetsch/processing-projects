# Moving_Circles_2

## Overview
"Moving_Circles_2" is the next iteration of the "Moving_Circles_1" project, introducing an intriguing 3D illusion. The concentric circles now move in such a way that they create the visual effect of a cone seen from above. As you move the mouse across the screen, the offset of the circles changes, allowing for dynamic patterns to emergeâ€”one of which resembles a flower.

This project was initially designed for the mobile version of Processing, but has been reformatted for desktop use to improve interaction and visual complexity.

## Features
- A 3D illusion effect of a cone created with concentric circles.
- Interactive movement: changing the mouse position alters the offset, creating varying patterns.
- Patterns include dynamic visuals such as a flower-like shape.

## How to Run
1. Open the `moving_circles_2.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Move the mouse to explore different visual patterns, including the illusion of a 3D cone and flower-like shapes.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future versions may focus on adding more interactive features, like allowing users to control the speed or depth of the illusion.

## Learnings
This iteration extended the concept of simple animations to include 3D visual illusions and interactive user input, opening the door for more advanced visual effects.
