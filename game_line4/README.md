# Game_Line4

## Overview
"Game_Line4" is a fully developed 3D game that extends the classic Tic-Tac-Toe concept into three dimensions. Players take turns placing spheres on a 4x4x4 grid, attempting to form a line of four consecutive spheres either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You can only place a sphere on a layer if there is a sphere on the layer below, simulating a gravity-like effect. The game features smooth animations with the board rotating for a better view of the action and has a clean and intuitive UI that ensures players can easily place their pieces in the correct spot.

## Features
- 4x4x4 3D grid for complex and strategic gameplay.
- Beautiful animations with a rotating board and smooth sphere placement.
- Gravity mechanic: players can only place spheres on top of other spheres.
- Intuitive UI to assist players in selecting valid positions for their moves.
- Automatic detection of winning combinations or ties.
- Aesthetic design for both spheres and the board.

## How to Play
1. Open the `game_line4.pde` file in Processing.
2. Press "Run" to start the game.
3. Players take turns placing spheres on the grid, trying to get four in a row.
4. Use the UI to choose the correct place to put your sphere. Remember, you can only place spheres on a layer if there is a sphere beneath it.
5. The game will detect and announce the winner when a player gets four in a row or when thereâ€™s a tie.

## Future Improvements
- Adding Player vs AI mode with different difficulty settings.
- Online multiplayer mode.
- Additional visual effects for winning sequences.

## Learnings
This project was a challenge in designing a 3D board game, implementing smooth animations, and ensuring the UI was intuitive. It helped solidify concepts of game mechanics, 3D rendering, and user experience.
