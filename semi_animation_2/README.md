# Semi_Animation_2

## Overview
"Semi_Animation_2" builds on the foundation of "Semi_Animation_1," but with a key difference: instead of rotating infinitely, the semicircle strips reverse their direction when they reach a specific angle threshold. This back-and-forth motion introduces a new dynamic to the animation, creating a pulsing, rhythmic effect as the semicircles continuously change direction.

This iteration expands the visual complexity by introducing constraints to the motion, resulting in a more controlled and deliberate animation style.

## Features
- Concentric semicircles rotating at different speeds.
- Strips reverse direction upon reaching a threshold angle, creating back-and-forth motion.
- Adds a rhythmic, pulsing effect to the animation.

## How to Run
1. Open the `semi_animation_2.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch the semicircles rotate, reversing direction once they hit a threshold, creating an oscillating visual pattern.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations could explore varying the angle thresholds for different semicircles or adjusting speed based on user input.

## Learnings
This project taught me about controlling rotation with conditional constraints, allowing for more structured animations. It also helped me explore how reversing motion can introduce a new rhythm to visual effects.
