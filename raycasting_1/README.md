# Raycasting_1

## Overview
"Raycasting_1" is a visual simulation that features a movable light source positioned at the mouse cursor. As the mouse moves, beams of light (represented by lines) are cast in all directions from the light source. These rays continue until they hit a wall, creating a visual effect of light interacting with obstacles. This project was developed as an initial exploration into raycasting techniques, and future iterations will build upon it.

Originally developed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted for the desktop version to improve performance and functionality.

## Features
- A dynamic light source that follows the mouse.
- Rays of light are cast in all directions and stop when they hit a wall.
- Interactive light and obstacle simulation.

## How to Run
1. Open the `raycasting_1.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Move the mouse to control the light source and watch as rays are cast around the scene.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- This is the first iteration of the raycasting simulation. Future versions will improve the accuracy of the raycasting and introduce more complex obstacles and light interactions.

## Learnings
This project helped me understand the basics of raycasting, particularly how light interacts with objects in a 2D environment. It also lays the groundwork for future, more advanced raycasting projects.
