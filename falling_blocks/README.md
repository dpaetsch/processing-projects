# Falling_Blocks

## Overview
"Falling_Blocks" is a program that replicates the iconic falling green symbols effect seen in the Matrix movies. Instead of symbols, this project uses green squares that fall from the top of the screen on a black background at a uniform speed, creating a visually captivating and minimalist aesthetic.

## Features
- Simulates falling blocks that move at the same speed, reminiscent of the Matrix's digital rain effect.
- Randomly generates the positions of the falling blocks, giving a sense of unpredictability and randomness.
- Simple yet hypnotic visual effect with black and green contrast.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in Processing.
2. Watch as green blocks continuously fall from the top of the screen at random horizontal positions.
3. Enjoy the simple yet mesmerizing visual effect.

## Demo


## Learnings
Through the development of "Falling_Blocks," I learned about controlling the positions and movement of objects in a grid-like fashion. This project helped me better understand looping over grids and creating a dynamic visual effect with simple elements.

## Future Improvements
- Add variable speed to make the blocks fall at different rates, introducing more dynamics.
- Implement interaction where the user can control the speed or number of falling blocks.
- Use different shapes or symbols instead of squares for more variation.
