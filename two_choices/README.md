# Two Choices

## Overview
This simple project was originally created to help decide whether to skip class or not. It features a button that, when clicked, randomly selects between two possible text options: "Skip" or "Don't Skip""

Originally developed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted to work on the desktop version.

## Features
- A button that randomly decides between two text options.
- Simple UI with a fun purpose.

## How to Run
1. Open the `two_choices.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Click the button to randomly get either "Skip Class" or "Go to Class."

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- A future enhancement could be adding more decision options or customizing the text choices.
- Could use additional UI elements, like a reset button or better styling.

## Learnings
This project was a fun way to learn about user input (via buttons) and randomness in Processing. It also demonstrates basic decision-making logic with simple text outputs.
