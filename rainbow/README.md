# Rainbow

## Overview
"Rainbow" is a simple yet versatile function designed to generate a smooth, continuous rainbow gradient effect based on a given parameter. This function can be used across various projects to add dynamic, colorful visuals. It has been utilized in other projects like the "Double_Pendulum" to color paths in a visually striking manner.

## Features
- Generates a smooth, continuous rainbow effect.
- Accepts a parameter to smoothly transition through the entire color spectrum.
- Easily integrable with other projects to add beautiful color effects.

## How to Use
1. Import the `rainbow()` function into your Processing project.
2. Pass a parameter to the function to generate a specific color from the rainbow spectrum.
3. Apply the color to your desired shapes, objects, or paths for stunning visual effects.

## Demo


## Learnings
Through the development of this function, I learned how to smoothly transition between colors using mathematical functions and manipulate color spaces effectively. It enhanced the visual impact of many other projects by providing a dynamic color palette.

## Future Improvements
- Add more parameters to control brightness, saturation, or specific color ranges.
- Create different color transition modes for varying visual effects.
