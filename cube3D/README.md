# Cube3D

## Overview
"Cube3D" is a simple program that displays a 3D cube at the center of the screen. The cube rotates based on the position of the mouse, but it remains fixed in the center and does not follow the mouseâ€™s movements. As you move the mouse, the cube responds by rotating, offering a basic but engaging 3D visual effect.

This project was my first experience with 3D programming and helped me understand the fundamentals of 3D transformations in Processing.

## Features
- A 3D cube that rotates in response to mouse movement.
- The cube remains fixed in the center of the screen, rotating along different axes based on mouse position.
- Smooth and responsive user interaction through mouse input.

## How to Run
1. Open the `cube3D.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Move the mouse around the screen to rotate the cube and observe its response to your input.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- This is a basic cube rotation program. Future iterations could introduce additional features like lighting, textures, or user-defined camera control for more advanced 3D effects.

## Learnings
This project introduced me to 3D programming concepts, such as transformations and rotations, and served as an excellent entry point into working with 3D spaces in Processing.
