# Game_Connect4

## Overview
"Game_Connect4" is a digital version of the classic Connect 4 game. Two players take turns dropping coins into a 7x6 grid, aiming to get 4 of their coins in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game automatically detects any winning condition or tie when the board is full. Additionally, the game keeps track of each player's wins on a scoreboard. The clean and polished design makes for an enjoyable, user-friendly experience.

Future improvements could include adding a Player vs AI mode with various difficulty settings, allowing players to compete against the computer.

## Features
- Two-player Connect 4 game with win and tie detection.
- Tracks player wins with a scoreboard.
- Supports all possible consecutive 4-coin orientations: vertical, horizontal, and diagonal.
- Clean, polished interface.

## How to Play
1. Open the `game_connect4.pde` file in Processing.
2. Press "Run" to start the game.
3. Players take turns clicking to drop their colored coins into the grid.
4. The first player to get 4 coins in a row wins, and the score is updated. If the board is full with no winner, a tie is declared.
5. Repeat for as many rounds as you like!

## Demo


## Future Improvements
- Adding a Player vs AI mode with adjustable difficulty settings to enhance single-player functionality.
- Option for game customization (coin colors, grid size, etc.).

## Learnings
This project explored game logic development for detecting various win conditions and ties in a grid-based game. Additionally, it demonstrated how to implement a user-friendly scoreboard and a clean game interface.
