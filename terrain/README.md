# Terrain

## Overview
"Terrain" is a procedural terrain generation program that creates a randomly generated mesh landscape using a noise function. The terrain moves towards the viewer, giving the illusion of flying rapidly above it. The program simulates a fast-paced flight over a dynamic, undulating landscape.

This project was originally developed for the mobile version of Processing, but due to hardware limitations on mobile devices, it has been reformatted for the desktop version for better performance.

## Features
- Procedurally generated terrain using noise functions.
- The terrain moves towards the viewer, simulating fast-paced flight over a landscape.

## How to Run
1. Open the `terrain.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch the terrain generate and move towards you, as if you're flying over it at high speed.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- The program faced hardware limitations when running on mobile devices, resulting in lower performance. Future improvements could involve optimizing the code for better performance on mobile platforms.

## Learnings
This project offered valuable experience in procedural generation using noise functions and handling performance limitations when developing for mobile devices.
