# Computer_Art_1

## Overview
"Computer_Art_1" is inspired by the visual aesthetics of early computer-generated art. In this project, colorful vertical lines move across the screen in a seemingly random yet controlled fashion, creating a retro, algorithmic art style. The movement of the lines evokes the randomness of old-school computer art, while still maintaining an underlying sense of structure and coherence.

This project aims to capture the charm of early digital visuals while exploring controlled randomness in generative art.

## Features
- Colorful vertical lines moving across the screen.
- Lines appear to move randomly but follow a controlled pattern, giving the artwork both chaos and order.
- Inspired by early computer-generated art aesthetics.

## How to Run
1. Open the `computer_art_1.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch as colorful vertical lines sweep across the screen in a visually engaging pattern.

## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- A potential future enhancement would be to add user interaction to adjust the speed or color of the lines.

## Learnings
This project gave me insight into combining randomness with control to create visually appealing generative art. It was a great exploration of algorithmic patterns and retro-style computer art.
