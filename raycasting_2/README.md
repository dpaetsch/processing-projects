# Raycasting_2

## Overview
"Raycasting_2" simulates a light source emitting rays in every direction, interacting with sparse boxes scattered across the screen. As the rays hit these boxes, they stop, illustrating the initial iteration of how light interacts with objects in a scene. This project serves as an exploration into the basics of light simulation and how light rays can be used to detect and react to objects in a virtual environment.

The project focuses on understanding the fundamental concept of raycasting and light interaction with objects.

## Features
- A light source emitting rays in all directions.
- Rays interact with and stop at boxes scattered across the screen.
- Demonstrates the first iteration of light interaction with objects.

## How to Run
1. Open the `raycasting_2.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Observe the light rays interacting with the boxes as they hit and stop, simulating basic light behavior.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations could involve refining the light simulation, adding more complex interactions, or optimizing the raycasting algorithm.

## Learnings
This project provided a foundational understanding of light simulation and raycasting, demonstrating how light can interact with objects and how this interaction can be visualized in a simple virtual environment.
