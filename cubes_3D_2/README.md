# Cubes_3D_2

## Overview
"Cubes_3D_2" is a visually captivating 3D simulation in which cubes of varying color, size, orientation, position, and pathing move across the screen while rotating. Each cube leaves behind a series of afterimages â€” perfect replicas that follow the original cube's path, creating a mesmerizing slow-motion effect despite the cubes moving at high speeds. This project was essential in improving my understanding of 3D transformations and modular code design in Processing.

## Features
- 3D cubes with randomized attributes: color, size, orientation, and movement path.
- Dynamic afterimages that trail each cube, enhancing the visual effect of slow motion.
- Continuous rotation and movement of cubes in different directions.
- Modular design that allows for easy adjustments and future iterations.
  
## How to Run
1. Open the `cubes_3D_2.pde` file in Processing.
2. Press "Run" to start the simulation.
3. Watch as the cubes move across the screen, rotate, and leave behind afterimages, creating a stunning visual display.

## Demo


## Learnings
This project helped solidify my understanding of 3D orientation and transformations, as well as modularizing code to create scalable, easily adjustable programs. I also learned about implementing visual effects like afterimages to give a sense of depth and speed manipulation.

## Future Improvements
- Customizable parameters for cube movement and afterimage behavior.
- User interaction to control cube attributes in real-time.
