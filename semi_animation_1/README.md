# Semi_Animation_1

## Overview
"Semi_Animation_1" is the first iteration in a series of visual animations featuring concentric semicircles. In this version, multiple semicircles of varying radii rotate at slightly different speeds, creating a mesmerizing and hypnotic effect. The semicircles resemble strips of half-circles, and their coordinated rotations produce a continuous, smooth motion.

This project was developed to explore the interplay of rotation, geometry, and visual rhythm in Processing.

## Features
- Multiple concentric semicircles, each rotating at a different speed.
- Varying radii of semicircles to create visual depth and complexity.
- Smooth and rhythmic animation of half-circle strips.

## How to Run
1. Open the `semi_animation_1.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch the semicircles rotate at different speeds, creating a dynamic visual effect.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations could introduce mouse interaction, color variations, or synchronization of speeds for more complex animations.

## Learnings
This project allowed me to experiment with rotating geometries and the effect of slightly different speeds on concentric shapes. It served as an introduction to creating fluid animations with basic geometric forms.
