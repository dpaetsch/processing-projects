# Colored_Grid_2

## Overview
"Colored_Grid_2" is the second iteration of the "Colored_Grid" series, adding user interaction to the random color changes. In this version, while each square in the grid still receives a random color, the brightness of the colors is influenced by the height of the mouse on the screen. As you move the mouse up and down, you can adjust the brightness of the entire grid, creating a dynamic and interactive visual effect.

This project further expands on the concept of color randomness, allowing for greater user control and customization.

## Features
- A grid of squares, each assigned a random color.
- The brightness of the colors is controlled by the height of the mouse on the screen.
- Allows users to interactively adjust the brightness by moving the mouse, adding a new layer of visual variation.

## How to Run
1. Open the `colored_grid_2.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Move the mouse up and down to control the brightness of the colors, watching as the grid's brightness shifts based on your input.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations could explore additional mouse-based interactions or different methods of controlling the color dynamics.

## Learnings
This iteration helped me explore how user input can influence visual effects. By incorporating mouse interaction, I learned how to map screen positions to RGB values and create a more engaging experience for the user.
