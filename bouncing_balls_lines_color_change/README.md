# Bouncing_Balls_Lines_Change

## Overview
"Bouncing_Balls_Lines_Change" is an evolution of the "Bouncing_Balls_Lines" project, where the balls now change color with each frame. As in the previous version, the background does not reset, so the previous frames remain visible, and the randomized color changes create vibrant, ever-shifting patterns of lines. The result is a mesmerizing display of motion and color.

Originally designed for the mobile version of Processing, this project has been reformatted for the desktop version to improve visual complexity and performance.

## Features
- 50 balls with random positions, velocities, and directions.
- Balls leave persistent trails, forming continuous lines.
- Colors of the balls are randomized with each frame, creating a dynamic visual effect.
- Balls bounce off the edges of the screen.

## How to Run
1. Open the `bouncing_balls_lines_change.pde` file in Processing (desktop version).
2. Press the "Run" button in the Processing IDE.
3. Watch as the bouncing balls leave colored trails that shift with each frame, forming vibrant, mesmerizing patterns.

## Demo


## Challenges / Unfinished Parts
- Future iterations could explore adding interactions between the lines, such as merging colors when two lines intersect.

## Learnings
This project deepened my understanding of visual persistence and dynamic color effects. By randomizing the color of each ball, I explored how simple changes can dramatically affect the visual impact of a project.
